# DeepIce---3rd-year-project
A Deep Neural Network investigation into the Quasi-Liquid Layer

Software Used:
  - LAMMPS - downloaded from: https://www.lammps.org/ (Version: LAMMPS-64bit-20Sep2021) - used to simulate Molecular Dynamics
  - VMD - downloaded from: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/ (Version: vmd194a53win64 (1.9.4 - windows 64bit)) - used to visualise atoms in different structures of ice
  - DeepIce - https://github.com/mfulford/DeepIce/blob/master/DeepIce.py - used to train the Deep Neural Network to identify and predict phases
  - Sub networks for DeepIce: https://github.com/mfulford/DeepIce
